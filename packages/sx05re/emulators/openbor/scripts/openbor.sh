# OpenBOR only works with Pak files, if you have an extracted game you will need to create a pak first.
# If master.cfg does not work, sound is weird or controller not working, you will need to use a keyboard to set your gamepad
# after you set up your gamne, copy the /storage/.config/openbor/Saves/{gamename}.cfg file to /storage/.config/openbor/master.cfg
# master.cfg will only be copied the first time you run that particular game.
